          <p class="bio-name">Samantha Stone:</p>
          <p class="bio-text">
            I’m the woman behind Nana’s Attic—born in New York City, polished by couture, and roughed up just enough by
            decades of late-night glamour. I never bothered with kids; I raised collections instead—leather jackets that
            survived studio basements, silk gowns that outlived their scandals, and more cigarettes than I’d ever admit.
            After a lifetime designing for runways, slipping into dresses meant for trouble, and dancing through nights
            that blurred into decades, I decided to “retire.” So here I am in Santa Cruz, opening a boutique that smells
            like old velvet, good perfume, and a little mischief.
            Elegant? Of course. Grungy? Always. And every piece in my shop carries a bit of my attitude—seasoned,
            stylish, and still very much a crazy free spirit.
