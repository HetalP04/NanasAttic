            These dresses came from a boutique that carried styles from the 1980s to the early 
            2000s. Dresses like this were especially popular for casual gatherings, school
            dances, and picnics. They were often worn by young adults who loved
            expressive prints, soft fabrics, and the mix of retro and early-2000s aesthetics.
